# Playground
This is the playground. Do anything here! If you are in a good mood leave comments above code you think the other could benefit from. Have fun!

## Posts
Posts is the example business unit where you can find clean services and components which both use ngrx store and effects.
Check out the posts section `(localhost:4200/posts)` and the corresponding code at `src/app/posts/`.

## rxjs cheat sheet
Navigate to the rxjs section `(localhost:4200/rxjs)` and open the browsers console.
Go to `src/app/rxjs/rxjs.component.ts` and uncomment the subscriptions you want to check out!

## Semantic playground
Navigate to the semantic playground `(localhost:4200/semantic)`.
Add or play with the components at `src/app/semantic-playground/components/`.
If possible try to leave it clean and reusable!
